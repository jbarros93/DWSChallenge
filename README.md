#The Asset Management Digital Challenge

To improve this project and turn it into a production application the following points could be considered:

- Using a real connection to a database would be an important improvement. Right now all the data in this project is being mocked;
- Monitoring tools would be a good addiction to trace transactions and errors;
- Making use of a TDD approach would improve and facilitate the addition of new features;
- A CI/CD workflow would be required for a better teamwork experience, and the deployment could be automated;
- Containerization with a tool like Docker would also help the developers develop, ship and run the application;
- Exception handling would improve if it was used a global exception handler;
- For the future, the microservices architecture should be used
